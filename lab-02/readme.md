# Lab 2: Function Templates 

Welcome to the second Data Structures lab of Spring 2020! The goal of this lab is to help expand your understanding of *function templates* and display how they can cut down on some repetitive coding.

1. Introduction to template functions
    - Syntax
    - Usage
2. Building Templated functions & Dataset Explanation 
3. Psuedocode
4. Submission 

# **Important Disclaimers**
Be sure to read and follow all instructions unless otherwise specified. Record your answers to the questions in a text document named `lab-02.txt`.

You are required to work with a group for this lab. **No individual submissions will be accepted in gradescope**. Keep in mind speed is **not** important when completing labs. Working together and understanding the contents of the lab is more important than just completing the lab.

Assume any example code in this lab requires at least C++11 to compile this can be done with the following command: `g++ -std=c++11 example.cpp`

# Part 1. Introduction to Templated Functions 

## 1.1 What are Templated Functions?
Function templates are incredibly useful when coding as it will prevent the need for re-writing the same functions in order to deal with different data types. It is important to note that a function template **is not an actual function, but instead is a pattern for what could become a function**


## 1.2 Syntax
The code below illustrates a template for finding the maximum number in a vector. The line containing the template declaration indicates that `T` is the template argument. This means that it can be replaced by any data type to generate a function. For example, if a call to `findMax` is made with a `vector<string>` as a parameter, then a function will be generated by replacing `T` with string. 

```c++
/*
    Return the maximum item in array a.
    Assumes vec.size() > 0.
    Comparable objects must provide operator< and operator=
*/
template <typename T>
const T & findMax(const std::vector<T> &a) {
    int maxIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 1 ; i < a.size() ; ++i) {
        if (a[maxIndex] < a[i]) {
            maxIndex = i;
        }
    }

    return a[maxIndex];
}
```

An example main function that uses the above function template can be found below. It is important to note that the line that calls `findMax(v4)` will **not compile**. This is because the comparison sign `<` has not been defined for void.

```c++
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v1(37);
    std::vector<double> v2(40);
    std::vector<std::string> v3(80);
    std::vector<void> v4(75);

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Additional code to fill in the vectors not shown
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    std::cout << findMax(v1) << std::endl; // OK: Comparable = int
    std::cout << findMax(v2) << std::endl; // OK: Comparable = double
    std::cout << findMax(v3) << std::endl; // OK: Comparable = string
    std::cout << findMax(v4) << std::endl; // Illegal; operator < undefined

    return 0;
}
```

:white_check_mark: Question 1: Compile the functions above and fix the errors given by the compiler.  What is the current output of the program?

:white_check_mark: Question 2: How would you fix the program to output a meaningful output?

:white_check_mark: Question 3: Would it be possible to call `findMax` with 2 parameters? If not, why?

## 1.3 Usage of Template Functions

The code below contains two template functions `bubbleSort` and `printingVector`, and the `main` function. The `main` function calls the template functions to sort vectors of ints, floats and strings!

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

template <typename T1>
void bubbleSort(std::vector<T1> &a) {
    for (int i = 0 ; i < a.size() - 1 ; i++) {
        // last i elements are already in place
        for (int j = 0 ; j < a.size()-i-1 ; j++) {
            if (a.at(j) > a.at(j + 1)) {
                std::swap(a.at(j), a.at(j + 1));
            }
        }   
    }
}

template <typename T1>
void printingVector(std::vector<T1> &a, std::string type) {
    // this will be used to print out the vectors.
    std::cout << type << " vector: ";
    for (int i = 0 ; i < a.size() ; i++) {
        std::cout << a.at(i) << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // initialize a vector
    std::vector<int> vecInt = {10, 13, 5, 7, 1};
    std::vector<float> vecFloat = {20.55, 12.32, 30.17, 3.27, 5.16};
    
    // this is used to initialize vecStr
    const char* vecWords[] = {"function", "templates", "make", "life", "easy"}; 

    // construct a vector from an array of strings
    // see: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/
    std::vector<std::string> vecStr(vecWords, std::end(vecWords));
    
    std::cout << "--------------" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Original vectors: " << std::endl;
    printingVector(vecInt, "int" );
    printingVector(vecFloat, "float" );
    printingVector(vecStr, "string" );
    std::cout << "--------------" << std::endl;

    // sort that vector using our template sort.
    bubbleSort<int>(vecInt);
    bubbleSort<float>(vecFloat);
    bubbleSort<std::string>(vecStr);
    
    
    std::cout << "Sorted vectors: " << std::endl;
    printingVector<int>(vecInt, "int");
    printingVector<float>(vecFloat, "float");
    printingVector<std::string>(vecStr, "string");

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```  
:white_check_mark: Question 4: Compile and run the code above and indicate the output.

:white_check_mark: Question 5: If the string vector changed to just contain the words "apple" and "act", which word would come first? 

# Part 2. Your Work

## 2.1 Building template functions

Your goal for this lab is to develop a templated **insertion sort** function to sort vectors of different data types.  You will use this function to analyze an input text file and print simple statistics. We are specifically interested in the following information:
- How **long** the longest and shortest word in the file are
- The first and last word in the file (according to **lexicographic (dictionary) order**)
    - i.e. Act before Apple
- The highest and lowest **word frequencies**
    - i.e. with the sentence: "Dog Dog Dog Cat", "Dog" has the highest word frequency making up 75% of the sentence and "Cat" has the lowest frequency, making up 25% of the sentence

The following example defines an example input text and the expected output of the program:

### Input:
```
I am a student. I want a degree.
```

### Output:
```
The shortest word was 1 character long
The longest word was 7 characters long
The first word (lexicographically) was "a"
The last word (lexicographically) was "want"
The lowest word frequency was 0.125
The highest word frequency was 0.25
```

A slimmed down version of the book *"Alice In Wonderland"* has been provided to test your code with. It has had all non-english words and proper nouns removed (for simplicity) and has had all words set to lowercase.

## Your Program
- write a templated function for sorting vectors, using the `insertionSort` algorithm, introduced in CSC 211, and available on the CSC 212 course website (slides on *Basic Sorts*)
- write a `main` function that takes a single *command line argument* (the file name of the input text file).  In the main function you should read in the words from the provided file into a vector of strings.  Then you will populate any necessary vectors for accomplishing the goals of the lab.  Finally you will sort all vectors using the `insertionSort` algorithm and print out the output to the console.  The output should match the format provided in the example above.

# Part 4. Submission 

You will submit two text files named lab-02.cpp and lab-02.txt. To reiterate **no individual submissions will be accepted for this lab on gradescope**. Please ensure your files contain the following: 

1. `lab-02.cpp` should contain your entire source code
2. `lab-02.txt` should contain your answers for all questions
