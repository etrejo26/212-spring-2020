the went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down so suddenly that had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well
either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she 
at the sides of the well and that they were filled with
and here and there she saw and 
hung upon she took down a jar from one of the as
she it was orange marmalade but to her great
disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody so to put it into one of the as
she fell past it
well thought to herself after such a fall as this i shall
think nothing of tumbling down how brave theyll all think me at
home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top
of the house which was very likely true
down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how
many fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting
somewhere near the of the earth let me see that would be four
thousand down i think for you see had learnt several
of this sort in her in the schoolroom and though this 
was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there
was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over
yes thats about the right then i wonder what latitude
or longitude got to had no idea what latitude was or 
longitude either but thought they were nice grand to say
presently she again i wonder if i shall fall right through the
earth how funny seem to come out among the people that walk with
their downward the i think she was rather glad
there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the
right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is you know please maam is this new or and
she tried to as she as falling
through the air do you think you could manage it and what an
ignorant little girl shell think me for no never do to
ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
down down down there was nothing else to do so soon 
talking again miss me very much tonight i should think
was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at
teatime my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no
mice in the air afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very
like a mouse you know but do eat bats i wonder and here 
to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy
sort of way do eat bats do eat bats and sometimes do 
bats eat for you see as she answer either question
it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was 
off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
and saying to her very earnestly now tell me the truth
did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
was not a bit hurt and she up on to her in a moment
she up but it was all dark overhead before her was another
long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight down it
there was not a moment to be lost away went like the wind and
was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my 
and how late its getting she was close behind it when she 
turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of hanging
from the roof
there were all round the hall but they were all locked and when
had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every
door she sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to
get out again
suddenly she came upon a little table all made of solid
glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and 
first thought was that it might belong to one of the of the hall
but alas either the were too large or the key was too small
but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second
time round she came upon a low curtain she had not before and
behind it was a little door about fifteen high she tried the
little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted
the door and found that it led into a small passage not
much than a rathole she knelt down and along the passage
into the garden you ever saw how she to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among those of bright and 
those cool but she could not even get her head through the
doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor it
would be of very little use without my oh how i wish i could
shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin
for you see so many had lately
that had begun to think that very few indeed were really
impossible
there to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went
back to the table half she might find another key on it or at
any rate a book of for shutting people up like this
time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here
before said and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label with the drink me beautifully printed on it in large

it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little was 
not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and
see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice
little about who had got burnt and eaten up by wild
and other unpleasant all because they would not remember
the simple their had taught them such as that a 
poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your
finger very deeply with a knife it usually and she had never
forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is
almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later
however this bottle was not marked poison so to taste
it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour
of custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot
buttered toast she very soon finished it off
what a curious feeling said i must be shutting up like a 
telescope
and so it was indeed she was now only ten high and her face
up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden first however she
for a few to see if she was going to shrink any further
she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said
to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder
what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
ever seen such a thing
after a while finding that nothing more she decided on going
into the garden at once but alas for poor when she got to the 
door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she 
went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach
it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her
best to climb up one of the of the table but it was too slippery
and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing
sat down and cried
come theres no use in crying like that said to herself
rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally
gave herself very good advice though she very seldom it
and sometimes she herself so severely as to bring into
her and once she trying to box her own for 
herself in a game of croquet she was against herself 
for this curious child was very of to be two people
but its no use now thought poor to pretend to be two people
why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table
she it and found in it a very small cake on which the 
eat me were beautifully marked in well ill eat it said
and if it me grow i can reach the key and if it 
me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill
get into the garden and i dont care which 
she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which 
way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing and she was quite to find that she the same
size to be sure this generally when one eats cake but 
had got so much into the way of nothing but 
to happen that it quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way
so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
chapter the pool of 
and cried she was so much that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good now 
opening out like the telescope that ever was 
for when she down at her they to be almost out of
sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little i wonder
who will put on your and for you now sure
i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you you must manage the best way you i must be
kind to them thought or perhaps they wont walk the way i want
to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every 
and she went on to herself how she would manage it they must
go by the carrier she thought and how funny seem sending
to own and how odd the will look
right foot 
hearthrug
near the fender
with love
oh dear what nonsense talking
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was
now more than nine high and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door
poor it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to
look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more
hopeless than ever she sat down and to cry again
you ought to be ashamed of yourself said a great girl like
you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this 
moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding of
until there was a large pool all round her about four 
deep and reaching half down the hall
after a time she a little of in the distance and
she hastily dried her to see what was coming it was the white
rabbit splendidly dressed with a pair of white in
one hand and a large fan in the other he came along in a great
hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess 
oh wont she be savage if kept her waiting felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit
came near her she in a low timid voice if you please sir
the rabbit violently the white and the fan
and away into the darkness as hard as he could go
took up the fan and and as the hall was very hot she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how
queer everything is today and yesterday went on just as usual
i wonder if been in the night let me think was i the 
same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a
little different but if not the same the next question is who
in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she thinking
over all the she knew that were of the same age as herself to
see if she could have been for any of them
sure not she said for her hair goes in such long
and mine doesnt go in at all and sure i cant
be for i know all of and she oh she such a
very little besides she and i dear how puzzling
it all is ill try if i know all the i used to know let me
see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and 
four times seven dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate
however the multiplication table doesnt signify try geography
is the capital of and is the capital of and 
thats all wrong certain i must have been for
ill try and say how the little and she crossed her
on her lap as if she were saying and to repeat it
but her voice hoarse and strange and the did not come the 
same as they used to do
how the little crocodile
improve his shining tail
and pour the of the 
on every golden scale
how cheerfully he to grin
how neatly spread his 
and welcome little in
with gently smiling 
sure those are not the right said poor and her 
filled with again as she went on i must be after all and
i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to 
no to play with and oh ever so many to learn no 
made up my mind about it if ill stay down here be no
use their their down and saying come up again dear i
shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then 
if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here
till somebody oh dear cried with a sudden burst
of i do wish they would put their down i am so very tired
of being all alone here
as she said this she down at her and was to see
that she had put on one of the little white while
she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must
be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now
about two high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she 
it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
that was a narrow escape said a good deal frightened at the
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and
now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door
but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was 
lying on the glass table as before and are worse than ever
thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never 
and i declare its too bad that it is
as she said these her foot slipped and in another moment splash
she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she 
had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by
railway she said to herself had been to the seaside once in
her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go
to on the coast you find a number of bathing in the 
sea some digging in the sand with wooden then a row
of lodging and behind them a railway station however she soon
made out that she was in the pool of which she had wept when she 
was nine high
i wish i cried so much said as she swam about trying
to find her way out i shall be for it now i suppose by
being in my own that will be a queer thing to be sure
however everything is queer today
just then she something splashing about in the pool a little way
off and she swam to make out what it was at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she how small
she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself
would it be of any use now thought to speak to this mouse
everything is so down here that i should think very
likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she
o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired
of swimming about here o mouse thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but
she seen in her grammar a 
a a mouse the mouse at her rather
inquisitively and to her to wink with one of its little 
but it said nothing
perhaps it doesnt understand thought i daresay its
a mouse come over with the conqueror for with all
her knowledge of history had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had so she again ma which
was the first sentence in her the mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water and to quiver all over with fright
oh i beg your pardon cried hastily afraid that she had hurt
the poor i quite forgot you didnt like 
not like cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would
you like if you were me
well perhaps not said in a soothing tone dont be angry
about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat i think youd
take a fancy to if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet
thing went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the
pool and she purring so nicely by the fire licking her and 
washing her she is such a nice soft thing to 
such a capital one for catching i beg your pardon cried
again for this time the mouse was all over and she
felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any
more if youd rather not
we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his
tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always 
nasty low vulgar dont let me hear the name again
i wont indeed said in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation are you dogs the mouse did not
answer so went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near
our house i should like to show you a little terrier you 
know with oh such long curly brown hair and fetch when
you throw them and sit up and beg for its dinner and all 
of cant remember half of it to a farmer
you know and he its so useful its worth a hundred he 
it all the dear cried in a sorrowful
tone afraid offended it again for the mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went
so she softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we
wont talk about or dogs either if you dont like them when the
mouse this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its
face was quite pale with passion thought and it said in a low
trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my
history and understand why it is i hate and dogs
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the 
and that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo
a lory and an eaglet and several other curious led the
way and the whole party swam to the shore
chapter a and a long tale
they were indeed a party that on the 
with the with their fur clinging close
to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable
the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a
consultation about this and after a few it quite natural
to to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had
known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the
lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than
you and must know better and this would not allow without
knowing how old it was and as the lory positively to tell its
age there was no more to be said
at last the mouse who to be a person of authority among them
out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you 
dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse
in the middle kept her anxiously fixed on it for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon
ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this
is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please 
the conqueror whose cause was by the pope was soon 
to by the who and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest and the of
and 
ugh said the lory with a shiver
i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did
you speak
not i said the lory hastily
i thought you did said the mouse i proceed and 
the of and declared for him and even 
the patriotic archbishop of found it advisable
found what said the duck
found it the mouse rather crossly of course you know what
it 
i know what it well enough when i find a thing said the
duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the 
archbishop find
the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found
it advisable to go with atheling to meet and offer him the
crown conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his
how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning
to as it spoke
as wet as ever said in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to
dry me at all
in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its i move
that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic

speak said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half
those long and whats more i dont believe you do either and 
the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other 
audibly
what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that
the best thing to get us dry would be a 
what is a said not that she much to know
but the dodo had as if it thought that somebody ought to speak
and no one else to say anything
why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as
you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell
you how the dodo it
first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact
shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were 
along the course here and there there was no one two three and 
away but they running when they and left off when they 
so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however
when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again
the dodo suddenly out the race is over and they all crowded
round it panting and but who won
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought
and it sat for a long time with one finger upon its forehead
the position in which you usually see in the 
of him while the rest in silence at last the dodo said
everybody won and all must have 
but who is to give the quite a chorus of 
why she of course said the dodo pointing to with one finger
and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused
way 
had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her 
pocket and out a box of luckily the salt water had
not got into it and handed them round as there was exactly one
apiece all round
but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse
of course the dodo very gravely what else have you got in
your pocket he went on turning to 
only a thimble said sadly
hand it over here said the dodo
then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly
the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered
thought the whole thing very absurd but they all so grave
that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything
to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she 
could
the next thing was to eat the this some noise and
confusion as the large that they could not taste
theirs and the small and had to be on the back
however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and 
the mouse to tell them something more
you to tell me your history you know said and why
it is you and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it 
would be offended again
mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to and 
sighing
it is a long tail certainly said looking down with wonder at
the tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling
about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was 
something like this
fury said to a
mouse that he
met in the
house
let us
both go to
law i will
prosecute

ill take no
denial we
must have a
trial for
really this
morning 
nothing
to do
said the
mouse to the
cur such
a trial
dear sir
with
no jury
or judge
would be
wasting
our
breath
ill be
judge ill
be jury
said
cunning
old fury
ill
try the
whole
cause
and
condemn
you
to
death
you are not said the mouse to severely what are you 
thinking of
i beg your pardon said very humbly you had got to the fifth
bend i think
i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily
a knot said always ready to make herself useful and looking
anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it
i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking
away you insult me by talking such nonsense
i didnt mean it poor but so easily offended
you know
the mouse only in reply
please come back and finish your story after it and the
all in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook
its head impatiently and a little 
what a pity it wouldnt stay the lory as soon as it was quite
out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose
your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little
snappishly enough to try the patience of an oyster
i wish i had our here i know i do said aloud 
nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back
and who is if i might venture to ask the question said the 
lory
eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet
our cat and such a capital one for catching mice you
cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the why
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it
this speech a remarkable sensation among the party some of the 
hurried off at once one old magpie wrapping itself up very
carefully i really must be getting home the 
doesnt suit my throat and a canary out in a trembling voice to
its come away my its high time you were all in bed
on various they all off and was soon left alone
i wish i she said to herself in a melancholy
tone nobody to like her down here and sure the best
cat in the world oh my dear i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more and here poor to cry again for she felt very
lonely and in a little while however she again 
a little of in the distance and she up
eagerly half that the mouse had his mind and was coming
back to finish his story
chapter the rabbit in a little bill
it was the white rabbit slowly back again and looking
anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she 
it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear oh 
my fur and shell get me executed as sure as are
where can i have them i wonder in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white 
and she very hunting about for them but they were
nowhere to be to have since her swim in
the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door
had completely
very soon the rabbit as she went hunting about and
out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing
out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of and a fan
quick now and was so much frightened that she ran off at once
in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it 
had made
he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how
hell be when he out who i am but id better take him
his fan and is if i can find them as she said this she 
came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the
real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the 
fan and 
how queer it said to herself to be going for
a rabbit i suppose be sending me on next and she
the sort of thing that would happen miss come
here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute
nurse but got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont
think went on that let stop in the house if it
people about like that
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three 
of tiny white she took up the fan and a pair of the 
and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the there was no label this time
with the drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it 
to her i know something interesting is sure to happen she said
to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what
this bottle does i do hope make me grow large again for really
quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
it did so indeed and much sooner than she had before she had 
drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put
down the bottle saying to herself thats quite hope i shant
grow any it is i cant get out at the do wish i 
drunk quite so much
alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing 
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there
was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out
of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i
can do no more whatever what will become of me
luckily for the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
and she grew no still it was very uncomfortable and as there
to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again no wonder she felt unhappy
it was much at home thought poor when one wasnt
always growing and smaller and being ordered about by mice and 
i almost wish i gone down that 
rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what
can have to me when i used to read i fancied that
kind of thing never and now here i am in the middle of one
there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i
grow up ill write grown up now she added in a sorrowful
tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here
but then thought shall i never get any older than i am
now be a comfort one to be an old 
to have to learn oh i shouldnt like that
oh you foolish she herself how can you learn
in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all
for any 
and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making
quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few she 
a voice outside and stopped to listen
mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my this moment
then came a little of on the knew it was
the rabbit coming to look for her and she till she shook the 
house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as
the door inwards and elbow was hard against it
that attempt proved a failure it say to itself then ill
go round and get in at the window
that you wont thought and after waiting till she fancied
she the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her
hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything
but she a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass
from which she that it was just possible it had fallen into a
or something of the sort
next came an angry pat where are you and
then a voice she had never before sure then here digging
for yer 
digging for indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and
help me out of this of more broken glass
now tell me pat whats that in the window
sure its an arm yer he pronounced it 
an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it the whole
window
sure it does yer but its an arm for all that
well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away
there was a long silence after this and could only hear 
now and then such as sure i dont like it yer at all at 
all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her
hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were
two little and more of broken glass what a number of 
there must be thought i wonder what theyll do
next as for me out of the window i only wish they could 
sure i dont want to stay in here any longer
she for some time without hearing anything more at last came a
rumbling of little and the sound of a good many 
all talking together she made out the the other
i to bring but one got the 
fetch it here put em up at this tie em 
together dont reach half high enough theyll
do well enough dont be bill catch hold of this
the roof that loose its coming
down below a loud who did was bill i
to go down the i shant you do i 
wont to go bill the master to 
go down the chimney
oh so got to come down the chimney he said to 
herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in
place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but
i think i can kick a little
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and 
till she a little animal she guess of what sort it was
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then
saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and to 
see what would happen next
the first thing she was a general chorus of there goes bill
then the voice him you by the hedge then 
silence and then another confusion of up his 
choke was it old fellow what to you tell
us all about it
last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought
well i hardly more thank ye better 
a deal too to tell i know is something comes at me
like a and up i goes like a skyrocket
so you did old fellow said the 
we must burn the house down said the voice and 
out as loud as she could if you do ill set at you 
there was a dead silence instantly and thought to herself i
wonder what they will do next if they had any sense take the
roof off after a minute or two they moving about again and
the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with
a barrowful of what thought but she had not long to doubt
for the next moment a shower of little came rattling in at the 
window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this
she said to herself and out youd better not do that again
which produced another dead silence
with some surprise that the were all turning into
little as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her
head if i eat one of these she thought its sure to make
some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me it must
make me smaller i suppose
so she one of the and was delighted to find that she 
shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through
the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little
and waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was
in the middle being up by two who were giving it
something out of a bottle they all made a rush at the moment she
but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood
the first thing got to do said to herself as she 
about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be
the best plan
it an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply
the only difficulty was that she had not the idea
how to set about it and while she was about anxiously among
the a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a 
great hurry
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round and
feebly out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing
said in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing
hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and
it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy into the air off
all its at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick
and made believe to worry it then behind a great thistle
to keep herself from being run over and the moment she on the 
other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head
over in its hurry to get hold of it then thinking it was
very like a game of play with a and every
moment to be under its ran round the thistle again then
the puppy a series of short at the stick running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely
all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great half shut
this to a good opportunity for making her escape so she
set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and 
till the bark quite faint in the distance
and yet what a dear little puppy it was said as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself and herself with one of the
leaves i should have teaching it very much id
only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that
got to grow up again let me is it to be i
suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great
question is what
the great question certainly was what all round her at
the and the of grass but she did not see anything that
like the right thing to eat or drink under the 
there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as
herself and when she had under it and on both sides of it and 
behind it it to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it
she herself up on tiptoe and over the edge of the 
mushroom and her immediately met those of a large caterpillar
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long
hookah and taking not the notice of her or of anything else
chapter v advice from a caterpillar
the caterpillar and at each other for some time in silence
at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and 
her in a languid sleepy voice
who are you said the caterpillar
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation 
rather shyly hardly know sir just at least i know 
who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been
several times since then
what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain
yourself
i cant explain myself afraid sir said because not
myself you see
i dont see said the caterpillar
afraid i cant put it more clearly very politely
for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many
different sizes in a day is very 
it said the caterpillar
well perhaps you havent found it so yet said but when you 
have to turn into a will some day you then
after that into a butterfly i should think feel it a little
queer wont you
not a bit said the caterpillar
well perhaps your may be different said all i know
is it would feel very queer to me
you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you 
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
felt a little at the making such very
short and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think
you ought to tell me who you are first
why said the caterpillar
here was another puzzling question and as could not think of any
good reason and as the caterpillar to be in a very unpleasant
state of mind she turned away
come back the caterpillar after her something important
to say
this promising certainly turned and came back again
keep your temper said the caterpillar
is that all said down her anger as well as she
could
no said the caterpillar
thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some
it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its
arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think
do you
afraid i am sir said i cant remember as i 
i dont keep the same size for ten together
cant remember what said the caterpillar
well tried to say how the little busy bee but it all came
different in a very melancholy voice
repeat you are old father said the caterpillar
folded her and 
you are old father the young man said
and your hair become very white
and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think at your age it is right
in my youth father to his son
i feared it might injure the brain
but now that perfectly sure i have none
why i do it again and again 
you are old said the youth as i before
and have grown most uncommonly fat
yet you turned a in at the door
pray what is the reason of that
in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey 
i kept all my very supple
by the use of this shilling the box
allow me to sell you a couple
you are old said the youth and your are too weak
for anything than suet
yet you finished the goose with the and the beak
pray how did you manage to do it
in my youth said his father i took to the law
and each case with my wife
and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
the rest of my life
you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
that your eye was as steady as ever
yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
what made you so awfully clever
i have three and that is enough
said his father dont give yourself 
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
be off or ill kick you down 
that is not said right said the caterpillar
not quite right afraid said timidly some of the 
have got 
it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and
there was silence for some 
the caterpillar was the first to speak
what size do you want to be it 
oh not particular as to size hastily only one
doesnt like so often you know
i dont know said the caterpillar
said nothing she had never been so much in her life
before and she felt that she was losing her temper
are you content now said the caterpillar
well i should like to be a little sir if you wouldnt mind
said three is such a wretched height to be
it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily 
itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three high
but not used to it poor in a piteous tone and
she thought of herself i wish the wouldnt be so easily
offended
get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the 
hookah into its mouth and smoking again
this time patiently until it chose to speak again in
a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the
mushroom and away in the grass merely as it went
one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you 
grow shorter
one side of what the other side of what thought to herself
of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had it
aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying
to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly
round she found this a very difficult question however at last she 
her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand
and now which is which she said to herself and a little of
the bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt
that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she 
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was 
so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her 
mouth but she did it at last and to swallow a morsel of the
bit
come my free at last said in a tone of delight which
into alarm in another moment when she found that her 
were nowhere to be found all she could see when she down was
an immense length of neck which to rise like a stalk out of a 
sea of green leaves that lay far below her
what can all that green stuff be said and where have my
got to and oh my poor how is it i cant see you
she was moving them about as she spoke but no result to follow
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
as there to be no chance of getting her up to her head she
tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her 
neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had
just in it down into a graceful zigzag and was going
to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops
of the under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and
was beating her violently with its 
serpent the pigeon
not a serpent said indignantly let me alone
serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone
and added with a kind of sob tried every way and nothing 
to suit them
i havent the least idea what talking about said 
tried the of and tried and tried 
the pigeon went on without to her but those
theres no pleasing them
was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the said the pigeon
but i must be on the lookout for night and day why i 
havent had a wink of sleep these three 
very sorry youve been said who was beginning to
see its meaning
and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the 
pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i 
should be free of them at last they must needs come down from
the sky ugh serpent
but not a serpent i tell you said aim a 
well what are you said the pigeon i can see trying to
invent something
a little girl said rather doubtfully as she 
the number of she had gone through that day
a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the 
contempt seen a good many little in my time but never one
with such a neck as that no no a serpent and theres no use
it i suppose be telling me next that you never tasted an
egg
i have tasted certainly said who was a very truthful
child but little eat quite as much as do you
know
i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre
a kind of serpent thats all i can say
this was such a new idea to that she was quite silent for a 
minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of 
looking for i know that well enough and what does it matter to me
whether a little girl or a serpent
it a good deal to me said hastily but not looking
for as it and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont
like them raw
well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled
down again into its nest crouched down among the as well as 
she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she 
that she still the of mushroom in her and
she set to work very carefully first at one and then at the
other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
in herself down to her usual height
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it 
felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few 
and talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done
now how puzzling all these are never sure what going
to be from one minute to another however got back to my right
size the next thing is to get into that beautiful is that 
to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open
place with a little house in it about four high whoever 
there thought never do to come upon them this size why
i should frighten them out of their so she at the
bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she
had brought herself down to nine high
chapter pig and pepper
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what
to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
considered him to be a footman because he was in livery
otherwise by his face only she would have him a
loudly at the door with his it was 
by another footman in livery with a round face and large like a 
frog and both had powdered hair that curled all
over their she felt very curious to know what it was all about
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen
the by from under his arm a great letter
nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other
saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen
to play croquet the repeated in the same solemn tone
only the order of the a little from the queen an
invitation for the duchess to play croquet
then they both bowed low and their got entangled together
so much at this that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next out the
was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the 
door staring stupidly up into the sky
went timidly up to the door and 
theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for
two first because on the same side of the door as you
are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could
possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
going on constant howling and sneezing and every now and then
a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to 
please then said how am i to get in
there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on
without to her if we had the door between us for instance
if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know
he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this
thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she
said to herself his are so very nearly at the top of his head
but at any rate he might answer am i to get in she
repeated aloud
i shall sit here the footman till tomorrow
at this moment the door of the house and a large plate came
skimming out straight at the head it just his nose
and broke to against one of the behind him
or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly
as if nothing had 
how am i to get in again in a tone
are you to get in at all said the footman thats the first
question you know
it was no doubt only did not like to be told so its really
dreadful she to herself the way all the argue
its enough to drive one crazy
the footman to think this a good opportunity for his
remark with i shall sit here he said on and off for
days and days 
but what am i to do said 
anything you like said the footman and whistling
oh theres no use in talking to him said desperately 
perfectly idiotic and she the door and went in
the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from
one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a stool in
the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring
a large which to be full of soup
theres certainly too much pepper in that soup said to herself
as well as she could for sneezing
there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess
occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a pause the only in the kitchen
that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear 
please would you tell me said a little timidly for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why
your cat like that
its a cat said the duchess and thats why pig
she said the last word with such sudden violence that quite
but she saw in another moment that it was to the baby
and not to her so she took courage and went on again
i didnt know that always in fact i didnt know 
that could grin
they all can said the duchess and most of em do
i dont know of any that do said very politely feeling quite
to have got into a conversation
you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact
did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she
was trying to fix on one the cook took the of soup off the 
fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at 
the duchess and the came first then a
shower of and the duchess took no notice of 
them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already
that it was quite impossible to say whether the hurt it or not
oh please mind what doing cried up and down in
an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off
if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse
growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does
which would not be an advantage said who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of 
what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth 
to turn round on its axis
talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head
rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take
the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and not to
be listening so she went on again i think or is
it twelve i
oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide 
and with that she nursing her child again singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of
every line
speak roughly to your little boy
and beat him when he 
he only does it to annoy
because he it 
chorus
in which the cook and the baby 
wow wow wow 
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing so
that could hardly hear the 
i speak severely to my boy
i beat him when he 
for he can thoroughly enjoy
the pepper when he 
chorus
wow wow wow 
here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to 
the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play
croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw
a after her as she went out but it just her 
caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a 
little creature and out its arms and in all just
like a starfish thought the poor little thing was snorting
like a when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and 
itself out again so that altogether for the first minute
or two it was as much as she could do to hold it 
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried
it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me
thought theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be
murder to leave it behind she said the last out loud and the 
little thing in reply it had left off sneezing by this time
dont grunt said thats not at all a proper way of 
yourself
the baby again and very anxiously into its face to
see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had
a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its
were getting extremely small for a baby altogether did not
like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing
she thought and into its again to see if there were any

no there were no if going to turn into a pig my dear
said seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind
now the poor little thing again or it was impossible
to say which and they went on for some while in silence
was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with
this creature when i get it home when it again so violently
that she down into its face in some alarm this time there could
be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said
to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it 
rather a handsome pig i think and she thinking over other
she knew who might do very well as and was just saying
to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she
was a little by seeing the cat sitting on a bough of a 
tree a few off
the cat only when it saw it she
thought still it had very long and a great many teeth so she
felt that it ought to be with respect
puss she rather timidly as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name however it only a little 
come its so far thought and she went on would you
tell me please which way i ought to go from here
that a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat
i dont much care where said 
then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat
so long as i get somewhere added as an explanation
oh sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long
enough
felt that this could not be so she tried another question
what sort of people live about here
in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round 
a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw a march
hare visit either you like theyre both mad
but i dont want to go among mad people 
oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here mad 
mad
how do you know mad said 
you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here
didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how
do you know that mad
to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grant that
i suppose so said 
well then the cat went on you see a dog when its angry
and its tail when its now i growl when and 
wag my tail when angry therefore mad
i call it purring not growling said 
call it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the 
queen today
i should like it very much said but i havent been 
yet
see me there said the cat and 
was not much at this she was getting so used to queer
happening while she was looking at the place where it had been
it suddenly again
what of the baby said the cat id nearly
forgotten to ask
it turned into a pig quietly said just as if it had come back
in a natural way
i thought it would said the cat and again
a little half to see it again but it did not
appear and after a minute or two she on in the direction in 
which the march hare was said to live seen before she
said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and
perhaps as this is may it wont be raving least not so mad as 
it was in march as she said this she up and there was the cat
again sitting on a branch of a tree
did you say pig or fig said the cat
i said pig and i wish you wouldnt keep and 
vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy
all right said the cat and this time it quite slowly
beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which
some time after the rest of it had gone
well often seen a cat without a grin thought but a grin 
without a cat its the most curious thing i ever saw in my life
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the 
were shaped like and the roof was with fur it
was so large a house that she did not like to go till she had
some more of the bit of mushroom and raised herself to
about two high even then she up towards it rather timidly
saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost
wish id gone to see the hatter instead
chapter a mad 
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the 
march hare and the hatter were tea at it a dormouse was sitting
between them fast asleep and the other two were it as a
cushion resting their on it and talking over its head very
uncomfortable for the dormouse thought only as its asleep i
suppose it doesnt mind
the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw 
coming theres plenty of room said indignantly and she sat
down in a large armchair at one end of the table
have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone
all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea
i dont see any wine she 
there any said the march hare
then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said angrily
it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being said
the march hare
i didnt know it was your table said its laid for a great
many more than three
your hair cutting said the hatter he had been looking at 
for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech
you should learn not to make personal said with some
severity its very rude
the hatter his very wide on hearing this but all he said
was why is a raven like a 
come we shall have some fun now thought glad 
begun believe i can guess that she added aloud
do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the 
march hare
exactly so said 
then you should say what you mean the march hare went on
i do hastily at least i mean what i 
the same thing you know
not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say
that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see 
you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i 
get is the same thing as i get what i like
you might just as well say added the dormouse who to be
talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing
as i sleep when i breathe
it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the 
conversation and the party sat silent for a minute while 
thought over all she could remember about ravens and 
which wasnt much
the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month
is it he said turning to he had taken his watch out of his 
pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then
and holding it to his ear
considered a little and then said the fourth
two days wrong the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit
the works he added looking angrily at the march hare
it was the best butter the march hare meekly 
yes but some must have got in as well the hatter 
you shouldnt have put it in with the 
the march hare took the watch and at it gloomily then he dipped
it into his cup of tea and at it again but he could think of 
nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter
you know
had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a
funny watch she it the day of the month and doesnt
tell what oclock it is
why should it the hatter does your watch tell you what
year it is
of course not very readily but thats because it
stays the same year for such a long time together
which is just the case with mine said the hatter
felt dreadfully puzzled the remark to have no
sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly i dont quite
understand you she said as politely as she could
the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he a little
hot tea upon its nose
the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its 
of course of course just what i was going to remark myself
have you the riddle yet the hatter said turning to 
again
no i give it up whats the answer
i havent the idea said the hatter
nor i said the march hare
wearily i think you might do something better with the
time she said than waste it in that have no 
if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk
about wasting it its him
i dont know what you mean said 
of course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously
i dare say you never even spoke to time
perhaps not cautiously but i know i have to beat time
when i learn music
ah that for it said the hatter he wont stand beating
now if you only kept on good with him do almost anything
you with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in
the morning just time to begin youd only have to whisper a
hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling one
time for dinner
i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper
that would be grand certainly said thoughtfully but 
shouldnt be hungry for it you know
not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to
one as long as you 
is that the way you manage 
the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he we
last before he went mad you know pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert
given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing
twinkle twinkle little bat
how i wonder what at
you know the song perhaps
something like it said 
it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way
up above the world you fly
like a in the sky
twinkle twinkle 
here the dormouse shook itself and singing in its sleep twinkle
twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop
well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the 
queen up and out murdering the time off with his
head
how dreadfully savage 
and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont
do a thing i ask its always six oclock now
a bright idea came into head is that the reason so many
are put out here she 
yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime
and weve no time to wash the between whiles
then you keep moving round i suppose said 
exactly so said the hatter as the get used up
but what when you come to the beginning again 
to ask
suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning
getting tired of this i vote the young lady us a story
afraid i dont know one said rather alarmed at the
proposal
then the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and
they pinched it on both sides at once
the dormouse slowly his i wasnt asleep he said in a
hoarse feeble voice i every word you were saying
tell us a story said the march hare
yes please do 
and be quick about it added the hatter or be asleep again
before its done
once upon a time there were three little the dormouse 
in a great hurry and their were and and 
they lived at the bottom of a well
what did they live on said who always took a great interest in
of eating and drinking
they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or
two
they have done that you know gently 
have been ill
so they were said the dormouse very ill
tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but 
why did they live at the bottom of a well
take some more tea the march hare said to very earnestly
had nothing yet in an offended tone so i cant
take more
you mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take 
more than nothing
nobody your opinion said 
making personal now the hatter triumphantly
did not quite know what to say to this so she herself
to some tea and and then turned to the dormouse and 
repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a well
the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then
said it was a 
theres no such thing was beginning very angrily but the
hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily
if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for
yourself
no please go on said very humbly i wont interrupt again i 
dare say there may be one
one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he to
go on and so these three little were learning to draw
you know
what did they draw said quite forgetting her promise
treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time
i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter all move one place
on
he on as he spoke and the dormouse him the march hare
into the place and rather unwillingly took
the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change and was a good deal worse off than
before as the march hare had just upset the into his plate
did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she very
cautiously but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle
from
you can draw water out of a said the hatter so i should
think you could draw treacle out of a stupid
but they were in the well said to the dormouse not choosing to 
notice this last remark
of course they were said the dormouse well in
this answer so confused poor that she let the dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it
they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing
its for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of
that with an m
why with an m said 
why not said the march hare
was silent
the dormouse had closed its by this time and was going off into
a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with
a little shriek and went on that with an m such as
and the moon and memory and know you say
are much of a you ever see such a thing as a 
drawing of a muchness
really now you ask me said very much confused i dont
think
then you shouldnt talk said the hatter
this piece of rudeness was more than could bear she got up in
great disgust and off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and 
neither of the took the least notice of her going though she
back once or twice half that they would call after her
the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into
the teapot
at any rate ill never go there again said as she picked her
way through the wood its the i ever was at in all
my life
just as she said this she that one of the had a door
leading right into it thats very curious she thought but
curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in 
she went
once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little
glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself
and by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that
led into the garden then she went to work at the mushroom she 
had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high
then she down the little passage and found herself at
last in the beautiful garden among the bright and the cool

chapter the 
a large stood near the entrance of the garden the 
growing on it were white but there were three at it busily
painting them red thought this a very curious thing and she went
to watch them and just as she came up to them she one of
them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like
that
i help it said five in a sulky tone seven my
elbow
on which seven up and said thats right five always lay the
blame on 
youd better not talk said five i the queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be 
what for said the one who had spoken first
thats none of your business two said seven
yes it is his business said five and ill tell was for
the cook instead of 
seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust
when his eye to fall upon as she stood watching
them and he checked himself suddenly the round also and 
all of them bowed low
would you tell me said a little timidly why you are painting
those 
five and seven said nothing but at two two in a low
voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a
red and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen
was to find it out we should all have our cut off you know
so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this
moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden 
out the queen the queen and the three instantly threw
themselves flat upon their there was a sound of many 
and round eager to see the queen
first came ten carrying these were all shaped like
the three oblong and flat with their and at the 
next the ten these were all over with
and two and two as the did after these came
the royal there were ten of them and the little came
merrily along hand in hand in they were all 
with hearts next came the mostly and and among
them the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
her then the knave of hearts carrying the 
crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand
procession came the king and queen of hearts
was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three but she could not remember ever 
of such a rule at and besides what would be the use of 
a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their
so that they see it so she stood still where she was
and 
when the procession came opposite to they all stopped and 
at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the 
knave of hearts who only bowed and in reply
idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to
she went on whats your name child
my name is so please your majesty said very politely
but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of after
all i be afraid of them
and who are these said the queen pointing to the three who 
were lying round the for you see as they were lying on their
and the pattern on their was the same as the rest of the 
pack she could not tell whether they were or or 
or three of her own 
how should i know said at her own courage its no
business of mine
the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast off with her head off 
nonsense said very loudly and decidedly and the queen was
silent
the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my
dear she is only a child
the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them
over
the knave did so very carefully with one foot
get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three
instantly up and bowing to the king the queen
the royal and everybody else
leave off that the queen you make me giddy and then
turning to the she went on what have you been doing here
may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going
down on one knee as he spoke we were trying
i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the 
off with their and the procession on three of the 
behind to execute the unfortunate who ran
to for protection
you shant be said and she put them into a large
flowerpot that stood near the three about for a
minute or two looking for them and then quietly off after the

are their off the queen
their are gone if it please your majesty the 
in reply
thats right the queen can you play croquet
the were silent and at as the question was
evidently meant for her
yes 
come on then the queen and the procession
wondering very much what would happen next
a very fine day said a timid voice at her side she was
walking by the white rabbit who was anxiously into her face
very said the duchess
hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he 
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon
tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered under
sentence of execution
what for said 
did you say what a pity the rabbit 
no i didnt said i dont think its at all a pity i said 
what for
she the the rabbit gave a little
scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the 
queen said
get to your the queen in a voice of thunder and
people running about in all tumbling up against each
other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game
thought she had never seen such a curious in
her life it was all and the were live 
the live and the had to double themselves
up and to stand on their and to make the arches
the chief difficulty found at first was in her flamingo
she in getting its body away comfortably enough under
her arm with its hanging down but generally just as she had got
its neck nicely out and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help out
laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin
again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was 
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she to send the 
hedgehog to and as the were always getting up
and walking off to other of the ground soon came to the 
conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed
the all at once without waiting for turns 
all the while and fighting for the and in a very short
time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and 
shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a
minute
to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any
dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute
and then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully
of people here the great wonder is that theres any one
left alive
she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she 
could get away without being seen when she a curious appearance
in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it 
a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself
its the cat now i shall have somebody to talk to 
how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with
till the and then its no use
speaking to it she thought till its have come or at least one
of them in another minute the whole head and then put
down her flamingo and an account of the game feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her the cat to think that there was
enough of it now in sight and no more of it 
i dont think they play at all fairly in rather a
tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear
oneself they dont seem to have any in particular
at least if there are nobody to youve no idea how
it is all the being alive for instance theres the 
arch got to go through next walking about at the other end of the 
i should have the hedgehog just now only
it ran away when it saw mine coming
how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice
not at all said so extremely just then she 
that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on
likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game
the queen and on
who are you talking to said the king going up to and looking
at the head with great curiosity
its a friend of cat said allow me to
introduce it
i dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may
kiss my hand if it 
id rather not the cat 
dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that
he got behind as he spoke
a cat may look at a king said read that in some book
but i dont remember where
well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he 
the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would
have this cat removed
the queen had only one way of settling all great or small
off with his head she said without even looking round
ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he
hurried off
thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
on as she the voice in the distance screaming with
passion she had already her sentence three of the to be
executed for their turns and she did not like the look
of at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which 
to an excellent opportunity for one of them with the
other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the 
other side of the garden where could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree
by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight
was over and both the were out of sight but it doesnt
matter much thought as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground so she it away under her arm that it might not
escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend
when she got back to the cat she was to find quite a
large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between
the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once
while all the rest were quite silent and very uncomfortable
the moment she was to by all three to settle
the question and they repeated their to her though as they 
all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said
the argument was that you cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a 
thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life
the argument was that anything that had a head could be
and that you werent to talk nonsense
the argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less
than no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious
could think of nothing else to say but it to the duchess
youd better ask her about it
in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here
and the executioner went off like an arrow
the head fading away the moment he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely
so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game
chapter the mock story
you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing
said the duchess as she her arm affectionately into and
they off together
was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen
when a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone
though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very
well its always pepper that people 
she went on very much at found out a new kind of
rule and vinegar that them camomile that 
them and such that make 
i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so
stingy about it you know
she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little
when she her voice close to her ear thinking
about something my dear and that you forget to talk i cant
tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in
a bit
perhaps it one to remark
tut tut child said the duchess got a moral if only
you can find it and she herself up closer to side as
she spoke
did not much like keeping so close to her first because the
duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon shoulder and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she 
bore it as well as she could
the going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up
the conversation a little
so said the duchess and the moral of that love
love that the world go round
somebody said whispered that its done by everybody minding
their own business
ah well it much the same thing said the duchess digging her
sharp little chin into shoulder as she added and the moral
of that care of the sense and the will take care of 
themselves
how she is of finding morals in thought to herself
i dare say wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist
the duchess said after a pause the reason is that doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experiment
he might bite cautiously not feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried
very true said the duchess and mustard both bite and 
the moral of that of a feather flock together
only mustard a bird 
right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of

its a mineral i think said 
of course it is said the duchess who ready to agree to 
everything that said theres a large near here and
the moral of that more there is of mine the less there is of 
yours
oh i know who had not to this last remark
its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but it is
i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that
what you would seem to if youd like it put more
imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have to them to be otherwise
i think i should understand that better said very politely if
i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say it 
thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess in
a tone
pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said

oh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make you a present
of everything said as yet
a cheap sort of present thought glad they dont give
birthday like that but she did not venture to say it out
loud
thinking again the duchess with another dig of her sharp
little chin
a right to think said sharply for she was beginning to 
feel a little worried
just about as much right said the duchess as have to fly and
the m
but here to great surprise the voice away even
in the middle of her word moral and the arm that was linked
into hers to tremble up and there stood the queen
in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm
a fine day your majesty the duchess in a low weak voice
now i give you fair warning the queen stamping on the 
ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in
about half no time take your choice
the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment
go on with the game the queen said to and was
too much frightened to say a word but slowly her back to the

the other had taken advantage of the absence and were
resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried
back to the game the queen merely that a delay would
cost them their 
all the time they were the queen never left off with
the other and shouting off with his head or off with her
head those whom she were taken into custody by the 
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the 
except the king the queen and were in custody and 
under sentence of execution
then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to have
you seen the mock turtle yet
no said i dont even know what a mock turtle is
its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen
i never saw one or of one said 
come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history
as they off together the king say in a low voice
to the company generally you are all come thats a good
thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of the queen had ordered
they very soon came upon a lying fast asleep in the sun
if you dont know what a is look at the picture up lazy
thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock
turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some
i have ordered and she off leaving alone with
the did not quite like the look of the creature but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage queen so she 
the sat up and rubbed its then it watched the queen till
she was out of sight then it what fun said the 
half to itself half to 
what is the fun said 
why she said the its all her fancy that they never
nobody you know come on
everybody come on here thought as she went slowly
after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never 
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came
could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she
him deeply what is his sorrow she the and the 
very nearly in the same as before its all his
fancy that he got no sorrow you know come on
so they went up to the mock turtle who at them with large 
full of but said nothing
this here young lady said the she for to know your
history she do
ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit
down both of you and dont speak a word till finished
so they sat down and nobody spoke for some thought to
herself i dont see how he can even finish if he doesnt begin but
she patiently
once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real
turtle
these were by a very long silence broken only by an
occasional exclamation of from the and the constant
heavy sobbing of the mock turtle was very nearly getting up and
saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could
not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said
nothing
when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly
though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the
sea the master was an old used to call him tortoise
why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one 
we him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle
angrily really you are very dull
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for such a simple question
added the and then they both sat silent and at poor
who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the said
to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it
and he went on in these 
yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it
i never said i didnt interrupted 
you did said the mock turtle
hold your tongue added the before could speak again
the mock turtle went on
we had the best of fact we went to school every day
been to a too said you be so 
as all that
with the mock turtle a little anxiously
yes said we learned and music
and washing said the mock turtle
certainly not said indignantly
ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in
a tone of great relief now at ours they had at the end of the bill
music and 
you have it much said living at the bottom of
the sea
i afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh i 
only took the regular course
what was that 
and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle
and then the different of 
distraction uglification and derision
i never of uglification to say what is it
the up both its in surprise what never of
it you know what to beautify is i suppose
yes said doubtfully it 
well then the went on if you dont know what to uglify is
you are a simpleton
did not feel to ask any more about it so she
turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn
well there was mystery the mock turtle counting off
the on his mystery ancient and modern with
then was an old 
that used to come once a week he taught us drawling and
fainting in 
what was that like said 
well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said too
stiff and the never learnt it
time said the i went to the master though
he was an old crab he was 
i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught
laughing and grief they used to say
so he did so he did said the sighing in his turn and both
their in their 
and how many a day did you do said in a hurry to
change the subject
ten the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so
on
what a curious plan 
thats the reason theyre the 
because they lessen from day to day 
this was quite a new idea to and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday
of course it was said the mock turtle
and how did you manage on the twelfth went on eagerly
thats enough about the interrupted in a very decided
tone tell her something about the now
chapter x the lobster quadrille
the mock turtle deeply and drew the back of one flapper across
his he at and tried to speak but for a minute or
two his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat
said the and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back at last the mock turtle his voice and with 
running down his he went on again
you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said
perhaps you were never even to a lobster
to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and
said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a 
lobster quadrille is
no indeed said what sort of a dance is it
why said the you first form into a line along the 
seashore
two cried the mock turtle salmon and so on
then when youve all the jellyfish out of the way
that generally some time interrupted the 
you advance twice
each with a lobster as a partner cried the 
of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to 
change and retire in same order continued the 
then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the 
the the with a bound into the air
as far out to sea as you can
swim after them the 
turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly
about
change again the at the top of its voice
back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock
turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two who had been
about like mad all this time sat down again very sadly
and quietly and at 
it must be a very pretty dance said timidly
would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle
very much indeed said 
come try the first figure said the mock turtle to the 
we can do without you know which shall sing
oh you sing said the forgotten the 
so they solemnly dancing round and round every now and 
then treading on her when they too close and waving their
to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly
and sadly
will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail
theres a porpoise close behind us and treading on my tail
see how eagerly the and the all advance
they are waiting on the you come and join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance
you can really have no notion how delightful it will be
when they take us up and throw us with the out to sea
but the snail too far too far and gave a look askance
said he the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
would not could not would not could not could not join the dance
what it how far we go his scaly friend 
there is another shore you know upon the other side
the further off from the is to 
then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance
will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance
thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said feeling
very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song
about the whiting
oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle seen them
of course
yes said often seen them at she checked herself
hastily
i dont know where may be said the mock turtle but if youve
seen them so often of course you know what theyre like
i believe so thoughtfully they have their in
their theyre all over 
wrong about the said the mock turtle would all
wash off in the sea but they have their in their and the 
reason is here the mock turtle and shut his her
about the reason and all that he said to the 
the reason is said the that they would go with the 
to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long
way so they got their fast in their so they get
them out again thats all
thank you said its very interesting i never knew so much
about a whiting before
i can tell you more than that if you like said the do you 
know why its a whiting
i never thought about it said why
it does the boots and the very solemnly
was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and she repeated
in a wondering tone
why what are your done with said the i mean what 
them so shiny
down at them and considered a little before she gave her
answer theyre done with blacking i believe
boots and under the sea the went on in a deep voice
are done with a whiting now you know
and what are they made of in a tone of great curiosity
soles and of course the rather impatiently
any shrimp could have told you that
if id been the whiting said whose were still running
on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we
dont want you with us
they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
wouldnt it really said in a tone of great surprise
of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and
told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise
dont you mean purpose said 
i mean what i say the mock turtle in an offended tone and
the added come hear some of your 
i could tell you my from this morning said
a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday
because i was a different person then
explain all that said the mock turtle
no no the first said the in an impatient tone
take such a dreadful time
so telling them her from the time when she first
saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first
the two got so close to her one on each side and 
their and so very wide but she courage as she went
on her were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her you are old father to the caterpillar and the 
all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath
and said thats very curious
its all about as curious as it can be said the 
it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i
should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to 
begin he at the as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over 
stand up and repeat the voice of the sluggard said the 

how the order one about and make one repeat 
thought i might as well be at school at once however she
got up and to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster
quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the came
very queer indeed
the voice of the lobster i him declare
you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair
as a duck with its so he with his nose
his belt and his buttons and turns out his 
later continued as 
when the are all dry he is gay as a lark
and will talk in contemptuous of the shark
but when the tide and are around
his voice a timid and tremulous sound
thats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the

well i never it before said the mock turtle but it 
uncommon nonsense
said nothing she had sat down with her face in her 
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
i should like to have it said the mock turtle
she cant explain it said the hastily go on with the next
verse
but about his the mock turtle how could he turn them
out with his nose you know
its the first position in dancing said but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing and to change the subject
go on with the next verse the repeated impatiently it
i by his garden
did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come
wrong and she went on in a trembling voice
i by his garden and marked with one eye
how the owl and the panther were a pie
later continued as 
the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat
while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon
was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon
while the panther received knife and fork with a growl
and the banquet
what is the use of all that stuff the mock turtle
interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most
thing i ever 
yes i think youd better leave off said the and was
only too glad to do so
shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the went
on or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song
oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind 
so eagerly that the said in a rather offended tone
no accounting for sing her turtle soup will you old
fellow
the mock turtle deeply and in a voice sometimes 
with to sing this
beautiful soup so rich and green
waiting in a hot tureen
who for such would not stoop
soup of the evening beautiful soup 
soup of the evening beautiful soup 


of the 
beautiful beautiful soup
beautiful soup who for fish
game or any other dish
who would not give all else for two
pennyworth only of beautiful soup
pennyworth only of beautiful soup


of the 
beautiful beautiful soup
chorus again cried the and the mock turtle had just begun
to repeat it when a cry of the beginning was in the 
distance
come on cried the and taking by the hand it hurried
off without waiting for the end of the song
what trial is it as she ran but the only
come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly
came carried on the breeze that them the melancholy 
of the 
beautiful beautiful soup
chapter xi who stole the 
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they
with a great crowd about of little
and as well as the whole pack of the knave was
standing before them in with a soldier on each side to guard
him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand
and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court
was a table with a large dish of upon it they so good
that it made quite hungry to look at wish get the
trial done she thought and hand round the but there
to be no chance of this so she looking at everything about
her to pass away the time
had never been in a court of justice before but she had read
about them in and she was quite to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to
herself because of his great wig
the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the 
wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did 
not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
and thats the thought and those twelve 
she was obliged to say you see because some of them were
and some were i suppose they are the she said
this last word two or three times over to herself being rather of
it for she thought and rightly too that very few little of her
age knew the meaning of it at all however would have done
just as well
the twelve were all writing very busily on what are they
doing whispered to the they cant have anything to put
down yet before the begun
theyre down their the whispered in reply for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
stupid in a loud indignant voice but she stopped
hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the 
king put on his spectacles and anxiously round to make out who
was talking
could see as well as if she were looking over their 
that all the were writing down stupid on their 
and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell
stupid and that he had to ask his to tell him a nice
muddle their be in before the over thought 
one of the had a pencil that this of course 
could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and 
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly
that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out
at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was
of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
herald read the accusation said the king
on this the white rabbit three on the trumpet and then
unrolled the parchment scroll and read as 
the queen of hearts she made some 
all on a summer day
the knave of hearts he stole those 
and took them quite away
consider your verdict the king said to the jury
not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great
deal to come before that
call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit three
on the trumpet and out first witness
the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of in the other i beg pardon your
majesty he for these in but i quite finished
my tea when i was sent for
you ought to have finished said the king when did you begin
the hatter at the march hare who had him into the 
court with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it
was he said
fifteenth said the march hare
sixteenth added the dormouse
write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three on their and then added them up and 
reduced the answer to and pence
take off your hat the king said to the hatter
it mine said the hatter
stolen the king turning to the jury who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact
i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation none of
my own a hatter
here the queen put on her spectacles and staring at the hatter
who turned pale and 
give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have
you executed on the spot
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting
from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the

just at this moment felt a very curious sensation which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to
grow again and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court but on second she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her
i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting
next to her i can hardly breathe
i cant help it said very meekly growing
youve no right to grow here said the dormouse
dont talk nonsense said more boldly you know growing
too
yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that
ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and
just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the 
of the court bring me the list of the in the last concert on
which the wretched hatter so that he shook both his off
give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you
executed whether nervous or not
a poor man your majesty the hatter in a trembling voice
and i begun my above a week or what with the
getting so the twinkling of the tea
the twinkling of the what said the king
it with the tea the hatter 
of course twinkling with a t said the king sharply do you
take me for a dunce go on
a poor man the hatter went on and most after
the march hare said
i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
you did said the hatter
i deny it said the march hare
he it said the king leave out that part
well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse 
nothing being fast asleep
after that continued the hatter i cut some more 
but what did the dormouse say one of the jury 
that i cant remember said the hatter
you must remember the king or ill have you executed
the miserable hatter his teacup and and went
down on one knee a poor man your majesty he 
a very poor speaker said the king
here one of the cheered and was immediately suppressed by
the of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just
explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied
up at the mouth with into this they slipped the 
head first and then sat upon it
glad seen that done thought so often read
in the at the end of there was some 
at applause which was immediately suppressed by the of the 
court and i never understood what it meant till now
if thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the
king
i cant go no lower said the hatter on the floor as it is
then you may sit down the king 
here the other cheered and was suppressed
come that finished the thought now we shall get
on better
id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the 
queen who was reading the list of 
you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court
without even waiting to put his on
and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the 
but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door
call the next witness said the king
the next witness was the cook she carried the pepperbox in
her hand and who it was even before she got into the
court by the way the people near the door sneezing all at once
give your evidence said the king
shant said the cook
the king anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice
your majesty must this witness
well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his were
nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are made of 
pepper mostly said the cook
treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
collar that dormouse the queen out behead that dormouse 
turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his

for some the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse
turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had 

never mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next
witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear
you must the next witness it quite my forehead
ache
watched the white rabbit as he over the list feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent
got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when
the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the 
name 
chapter evidence
here cried quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few and she up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the with the edge of her skirt
upsetting all the on to the of the crowd below and there
they lay sprawling about her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before
oh i beg your pardon she in a tone of great dismay and
them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the or
they would die
the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until
all the are back in their proper he repeated with
great emphasis looking hard at as he said do
at the and saw that in her haste she had put
the lizard in head and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got
it out again and put it right not that it much she said
to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial
one way up as the other
as soon as the jury had a little from the shock of being
upset and their and had been found and handed back to
them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident all except the lizard who too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the 
court
what do you know about this business the king said to 
nothing said 
nothing whatever the king
nothing whatever said 
thats very important the king said turning to the jury they were
just beginning to write this down on their when the white rabbit
interrupted unimportant your majesty of course he said in a
very respectful tone but frowning and making at him as he spoke
unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on
to himself in an undertone
as if he were trying
which word best
some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant
could see this as she was near enough to look over their 
but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself
at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in
his notebook out silence and read out from his book rule
all more than a mile high to leave the court
everybody at 
not a mile high said 
you are said the king
nearly two high added the queen
well i shant go at any rate said besides thats not a
regular rule you it just now
its the rule in the book said the king
then it ought to be number one said 
the king turned pale and shut his notebook hastily consider your
verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice
theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white
rabbit up in a great hurry this paper just been picked
up
whats in it said the queen
i havent it yet said the white rabbit but it to be a
letter written by the prisoner toto somebody
it must have been that said the king unless it was written to
nobody which usual you know
who is it directed to said one of the 
it directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres
nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and
added it a letter after all its a set of 
are they in the handwriting another of the 
no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the thing
about it the jury all puzzled
he must have somebody hand said the king the jury
all up again
please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they
cant prove i did theres no name at the end
if you didnt sign it said the king that only the matter
worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have your
name like an honest man
there was a general clapping of at this it was the first really
clever thing the king had said that day
that his guilt said the queen
it nothing of the sort said why you dont even know
what theyre about
read them said the king
the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin please
your majesty he 
begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you
come to the end then stop
these were the the white rabbit read
they told me you had been to her
and me to him
she gave me a good character
but said i could not swim
he sent them word i had not gone
we know it to be true
if she should push the matter on
what would become of you
i gave her one they gave him two
you gave us three or more
they all returned from him to you
though they were mine before
if i or she should chance to be
involved in this affair
he to you to set them free
exactly as we were
my notion was that you had been
before she had this fit
an obstacle that came between
him and ourselves and it
dont let him know she them best
for this must ever be
a secret kept from all the rest
between yourself and me
thats the most important piece of evidence weve yet said the 
king rubbing his so now let the jury
if any one of them can explain it said she had grown so large
in the last few that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting
him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of
meaning in it
the jury all wrote down on their she doesnt believe theres an
atom of meaning in it but none of them to explain the paper
if theres no meaning in it said the king that a world of
trouble you know as we try to find any and yet i dont know 
he went on spreading out the on his knee and looking at them
with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said
i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the
knave
the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which he 
certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard
all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over
the to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of
gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he
did with the you know
but it goes on they all returned from him to you said 
why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the 
on the table nothing can be clearer than that then she
had this fit you never had my dear i think he said to the
queen
never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard
as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily
again the ink that was trickling down his face as long as 
it 
then the dont fit you said the king looking round the court
with a smile there was a dead silence
its a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody 
let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the 
twentieth time that day
no no said the queen sentence afterwards
stuff and nonsense said loudly the idea of the 
sentence first
hold your tongue said the queen turning purple
i wont said 
off with her head the queen at the top of her voice nobody

who for you said she had grown to her full size by this
time nothing but a pack of 
at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon
her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and 
tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her
head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had down from the upon her face
wake up dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve
had
oh had such a curious dream said and she told her
sister as well as she could remember them all these strange 
of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had
finished her sister her and said it was a curious dream
dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late so
got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might
what a wonderful dream it had been
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her 
hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little and all her
wonderful till she too after a fashion and
this was her dream
first she of little herself and once again the tiny
were upon her knee and the bright eager were looking
up into could hear the very of her voice and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
would always get into her still as she or to
listen the whole place around her alive with the strange 
of her little dream
the long grass at her as the white rabbit hurried 
frightened mouse splashed his way through the 
could hear the rattle of the as the march hare and his 
their meal and the shrill voice of the queen
off her unfortunate to more the 
was sneezing on the knee while and 
around more the shriek of the the squeaking of the 
and the choking of the suppressed 
filled the air mixed up with the distant of the miserable mock
turtle
so she sat on with closed and half herself in
wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all
would change to dull grass would be only rustling in the
wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the rattling
would change to tinkling and the shrill
to the voice of the shepherd the sneeze of the baby the 
shriek of the and all the other queer would change she
knew to the confused of the busy the 
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock 
heavy 
lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would 
keep through all her riper the simple and loving heart of her 
childhood and how she would gather about her other little and 
make their bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even
with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with 
all their simple and find a pleasure in all their simple 
her own and the happy summer days
the end
